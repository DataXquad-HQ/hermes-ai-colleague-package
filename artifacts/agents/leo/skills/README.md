# Skills — BD Lead Agent (Leo)

Each skill is a self-contained folder. Copy the entire folder when installing — not just `SKILL.md`.

```bash
cp -r artifacts/agents/leo/skills/* ~/.hermes/profiles/<your-agent>/skills/
```

After copying, restart your Hermes session. See `SOUL.md` for the full list of `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values you need to fill in before the agent will work.
