# Leo — BD Lead Agent Capabilities

**Version:** 2.0 | **Last Updated:** 2026-06-10

---

## What This Role Does

Leo is an AI-powered BD Lead Agent. Leo assists the human sales rep in achieving two outcomes:

- **MoFu — SQL Creation:** Turn qualified contacts into active Deals. A contact becomes an SQL the moment a Deal is opened against them.
- **BoFu — Close:** Push active Deals to Closed Customer, and Partnership candidates to Signed Partner.

Leo is not a feature list. Leo is attention the human sales rep buys back. The success criterion for every Capability is the same question:

> "Does the sales rep still need to watch this themselves?"

---

## Scope Notes

- **Prospecting is out of scope.** All leads and partner candidates entering the CRM have already been validated — sourced from website inquiries, event contacts, or inbound outreach.
- **Routing is out of scope for now.** All deals are handled as Direct Sales.
- **Partner recruitment front-end is out of scope.** Partner candidates are pre-qualified before CRM entry. Leo manages progression only.

## Authority Grid

| **Action** | **Leo Can** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Pipeline updates, deal and engagement logging | ✅ Autonomous | Create/update Deal, Engagement, Task |

| Partner progression tasks and follow-up | ✅ Autonomous | Same flow as deal progression |
| Partner success monthly report | ✅ Autonomous generation | Detect red flags, recommend action, human decides |

## Capabilities

Each Capability is evaluated on three dimensions:  
**Trigger** — Can Leo detect when to act on its own?  
**Execution** — Can Leo complete the full flow without human help?  
**Quality** — Is the output directly usable by the sales rep?

**Architecture rule:** Every cron job maps to a skill. The skill holds all logic and supports both manual and automated triggers. The cron prompt is always one line — just a trigger, no logic inside.

---

### C1 — Maintaining Account Intelligence

> **Attention the sales rep buys back:** No need to manually research every new contact or remember to re-enrich stale accounts.

**Leo owns:** When a new lead enters the CRM — creating Account and Contact records, building GBrain pages for both, enriching with company background, assessing fit, and recommending the first action. Periodically re-enriching existing accounts to keep intel fresh.

**SQL definition:** A contact becomes an SQL the moment a Deal is opened against them. C1 is the gate before that — it ensures every contact is known and assessed before a Deal decision is made.

**Lead sources:** website inquiry form, event contact (entered by team), inbound outreach

**Trigger:** Sales rep reports new lead / new Account or Contact created  
**Boundary:** Intel depth is company-level (web search). Decision-maker mapping and pain point data are still manual.

| **Trigger** | **Execution** | **Quality** |
|-|-|-|
| ⚠️ Needs human to bring lead in | ✅ Account + Contact creation, GBrain pages, enrichment, triage recommendation all complete | ⚠️ Company-level intel only; decision-maker and pain point data still manual |

**Skills:** `capturing-sales-intel` · `account-onboarding` · `enriching-leads`  
**Cron:** → `account-enrichment-monthly` (1st of month, 20:00) — periodic re-enrichment of existing accounts

---

### C2 — Progressing Deals to Close

> **Attention the sales rep buys back:** No need to dig through history before a meeting. No need to organise follow-up actions after a meeting. No need to notice when a deal has gone quiet.

**Leo owns:** The full deal progression loop — from SQL to Closed Customer. When an Engagement is logged: analyse progression, update Deal status, generate Task + Agent Advice. Detect deals stalled 7+ days and flag them. Generate a meeting brief automatically the day before any Planned Engagement.

**Trigger:** Sales rep reports an interaction / Planned Engagement is tomorrow (automatic) / deal goes 7+ days without activity (automatic)  
**Boundary:** Leo does not decide whether to continue pursuing a deal — that judgment stays with the sales rep.

| **Trigger** | **Execution** | **Quality** |
|-|-|-|
| ⚠️ Post-meeting needs human to report. Stall detection and pre-meeting brief are automatic ✅ | ✅ Engagement logging + deal analysis + stall detection + meeting prep all running end-to-end | ⚠️ Deal narrative syncs to GBrain but long-term cross-session accumulation still maturing |

**Skills:** `engagement-logging` · `deal-progressing` · `meeting-prep` · `deal-advisory`  
**Cron:** → `daily-deal-health-check` (11:00 daily) · → `meeting-prep-daily` (09:00 daily)

---

### C3 — Progressing Partnerships to Agreement

> **Attention the sales rep buys back:** No need to track where each partner relationship stands or remember to follow up.

**Leo owns:** The full partnership progression loop — from candidate to Signed Partner. Identical logic to C2: log engagements, analyse momentum, generate Task + Agent Advice, detect silence (14+ days). The end goal is a signed partnership agreement, not a sales contract.

**Trigger:** Sales rep reports a partner interaction / partnership goes 14+ days without activity (automatic)  
**Boundary:** No partner sourcing — all candidates are pre-qualified. Contract terms require human decision.

| **Trigger** | **Execution** | **Quality** |
|-|-|-|
| ✅ Silence detection automatic; post-meeting still needs human to report | ✅ Partnership progression mirrors deal progression flow completely | ⚠️ No partner revenue tracking yet — cannot quantify partner contribution |

**Skills:** `managing-partnership-pipeline` · `engagement-logging` · `meeting-prep`  
**Cron:** → `daily-partnership-health-check` (11:00 daily) · → `meeting-prep-daily` (09:00 daily, shared with C2)

---

### C4 — Monitoring Pipeline Health

> **Attention the sales rep buys back:** No need to step back and assess the overall pipeline state. Leo surfaces the weekly picture — how much is moving, what is at risk, and whether the business is on track.

**Leo owns:** Weekly pipeline health review — across all Deals and Partnerships. Assess overall momentum, conversion trends, revenue forecast vs target, and systemic risks. Also generates the morning daily briefing to keep the sales rep oriented each day.

**Trigger:** Weekly automatic (end of week) / on-demand  
**Boundary:** No company-level financial forecasting. No product decisions.

| **Trigger** | **Execution** | **Quality** |
|-|-|-|
| ⚠️ Weekly cron not yet built; daily briefing is automatic ✅ | ⚠️ Weekly pipeline summary skill not yet built; reviewing-sales-pipeline works on-demand | ⚠️ Report format not yet standardised; no conversion trend or forecast vs target output yet |

**Skills:** `reviewing-sales-pipeline` · `reviewing-partnership-pipeline` · `daily-briefing` · *(pending)* `weekly-pipeline-review`  
**Cron:** → `daily-briefing` (08:00 daily) · → *(pending)* `weekly-pipeline-review` (Friday 17:00)

---

### C5 — Nurturing Cold Contacts

> **Attention the sales rep buys back:** No need to remember which contacts have gone cold or draft check-in messages from scratch.

**Leo owns:** Identifying contacts in CRM with no active Deal or Partnership and no engagement in 30+ days. Drafting a personalised outreach message for each. Delivering a batch draft list monthly for the sales rep to review and send.

**Trigger:** Monthly automatic (1st of month) / sales rep says "send a check-in to [contact]"  
**Boundary:** Sales rep decides whether to send each message. Leo never auto-sends relationship messages.

| **Trigger** | **Execution** | **Quality** |
|-|-|-|
| ✅ Monthly cron built | ✅ Detection and draft generation complete (Basic mode) | ⚠️ Content Engine not yet connected — article-based personalisation pending |

**Skills:** `lead-nurturing`  
**Cron:** → `lead-nurturing-monthly` (1st of month, 09:00)

---

### C6 — Maintaining Partner Success

> **Attention the sales rep buys back:** No need to track how much each signed partner is contributing or notice when one is declining.

**Leo owns:** Monthly check on all active (signed) partners — reviewing revenue trend and engagement recency. Alerting only when red flags appear: 3+ months at $0 revenue, partner goes from active to silent, or partner requests help but cannot execute.

**Trigger:** Monthly automatic / on-demand  
**Boundary:** Leo flags and recommends. Human decides whether to call, renegotiate, or offboard.

| **Trigger** | **Execution** | **Quality** |
|-|-|-|
| ⚠️ Monthly cron not yet built | ⚠️ Scorecard skill does not exist yet | ⚠️ Partner revenue data requires manual invoice check — cannot auto-calculate |

**Skills:** *(pending)* `partner-monthly-scorecard`  
**Cron:** → *(pending)* `partner-success-monthly` (1st of month, 09:00)

## Design Principles

**MoFu and BoFu Are Leo's North Star**  
Every Capability exists to serve one of two outcomes: creating SQLs or closing them. C1 and C5 feed the top of this funnel. C2 and C3 push through it. C4 monitors the whole. C6 protects what was already closed.

**C2 and C3 Are the Same Flow**  
Deal progression and Partnership progression share identical logic — log engagement, analyse momentum, generate Task with Agent Advice. One pattern, two CRM objects, two end goals.

**Every Cron Maps to a Skill**  
Cron jobs are triggers only. All logic lives in the skill. This means any Capability can be invoked manually at any time with identical behaviour.

**Silent by Default**  
Leo does not send messages unless there is something worth saying. Silence = everything is on track.

**Drafts, Not Sends**  
Leo never sends external communications autonomously. Every outbound message is prepared as a draft for human confirmation.

**GBrain Is Always Updated**  
Every new Account, Contact, and Engagement is automatically reflected in GBrain. Lark Base stores current facts. GBrain accumulates the narrative over time.
