# Daily Reminder

> The goal is simple: every active Sales Rep starts their day knowing exactly
> what they must do — and how to do it. Nothing lives only in Leo's memory.

---

## Purpose

Every morning, Leo:
1. Pulls all TODO tasks from Twenty CRM across all active reps
2. Prioritises by deadline (today → tomorrow → this week)
3. Caps at 10 tasks total per rep — closest deadlines first
4. Adds a suggested approach for each task
5. Delivers to the Sales Daily Update channel

---

## Who Gets Reminded

All people with active assigned tasks in CRM. Currently:
- **Hunter** — primary Sales Rep
- *(add new reps here as they join)*

Run the same logic for each rep. Deliver one consolidated message per rep,
or a single team message if preferred.

---

## Task Priority Logic

```
Layer 1 — Due TODAY (deadline = today)
Layer 2 — Due TOMORROW (deadline = tomorrow)

Count tasks from Layer 1 + Layer 2.

If total < 10:
  Layer 3 — Due THIS WEEK (deadline within 7 days, not already included)
  Add from Layer 3 until total reaches 10 or list is exhausted.

If total >= 10 at any layer: stop. Do not add more.
Cap = 10 tasks per rep.
```

**Special priority — always include regardless of cap:**
- Any task with title starting `[Log Interaction]` that is overdue
  → This means a meeting happened but was never reported back. Flag it clearly.
- Any task linked to an `AT_RISK` opportunity or partnership

---

## Task Output Format

For each task:
```
[Priority emoji] [Task title]
👤 Owner: [Rep name]
📅 Due: [date] ([today/tomorrow/this week])
🔗 Deal: [Opportunity or Partnership name] — [Stage] — [healthCheck]
💡 Suggested: [1-2 sentence recommended approach]
```

Priority emoji:
- 🔴 Overdue or AT_RISK deal
- 🟡 Due today or tomorrow
- 🔵 Due this week

**Special flag for unreported meetings:**
```
⚠️ [Log Interaction] — [Company] meeting on [date] not yet reported
👤 Owner: [Rep]
💡 Just message Leo with a quick update — even one line is enough to start.
```

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1 — Pull tasks from CRM

```graphql
{
  tasks(filter: {
    status: { eq: TODO }
    dueAt: { lte: "[end-of-week-ISO]" }
  }) {
    edges { node {
      id
      title
      dueAt
      assignee { id name }
      taskTargets {
        edges { node {
          targetOpportunity { id name stage healthCheck }
          targetPartnership { id name stage healthCheck }
        }}
      }
    }}
  }
}
```

Also pull overdue tasks (dueAt < today, status still TODO):
```graphql
{
  tasks(filter: {
    status: { eq: TODO }
    dueAt: { lt: "[today-ISO]" }
  }) {
    edges { node { id title dueAt assignee { id name } } }
  }
}
```

### Step 2 — Group by rep, apply priority logic

For each rep:
1. Collect all their TODO tasks
2. Sort: overdue first, then by dueAt ascending
3. Apply layer logic (today → tomorrow → this week), cap at 10
4. Always include `[Log Interaction]` overdue tasks even if over cap

### Step 3 — Recall context for AT_RISK deals

For any task linked to an AT_RISK deal, recall from {{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}:
```
POST /v1/default/banks/{{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}/memories/recall
{"query": "[Company] deal — current blocker and last interaction", "top_k": 3}
```
Use this to write a better suggested approach.

### Step 4 — Generate and deliver

Compose the message and deliver to the Sales Daily Update channel:

```
Lark group: {{SALES_CHANNEL_NAME}}
chat_id: {{LARK_SALES_CHANNEL_ID}}
```

## Pitfalls

- **Don't include completed tasks.** Filter `status: { eq: TODO }` only.
- **Don't exceed 10 per rep.** Closest deadlines always win.
- **Always flag unreported meetings.** `[Log Interaction]` overdue = silent deal risk.
- **Suggested approach must be specific.** "Follow up" is not enough. Say how, say what angle.
- **If a task has no linked deal**, still include it — just omit the deal line.

---

## Cron Schedule

Run every weekday morning at 09:00 Taiwan time (01:00 UTC).

```
cron: 0 1 * * 1-5
deliver to: {{LARK_SALES_CHANNEL_ID}}
```
