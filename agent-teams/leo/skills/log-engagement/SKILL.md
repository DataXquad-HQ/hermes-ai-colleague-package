# Log Engagement

> An Engagement is a completed, factual record of something that happened.
> It either exists (happened) or it doesn't — no status, no pending states.
> **Confirm before writing. Never go straight to CRM.**

---

## Purpose

Convert a Sales Rep's raw update (verbal, chat, meeting notes) into:
1. A structured **Engagement** (Note) linked to the Opportunity or Partnership
2. Updated **Opportunity / Partnership** fields reflecting current state
3. **Tasks** for every open action item

---

## The Two Objects

Same flow. Different silence thresholds.

| Object | Parent | Silence threshold | End state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opportunity | C4 | 7 days → `AT_RISK` | CUSTOMER |
| Partnership | C5 | 14 days → `AT_RISK` | Signed Partner |

---

## Step-by-Step Flow

### Step 0 — Recall Deal Context (do this FIRST)

Before extracting or confirming anything, recall the deal's history from Hindsight:

```
POST /v1/default/banks/{{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}/memories/recall
{"query": "[Company name] deal — background, blockers, last interaction", "top_k": 5}
```

## Step-by-Step Flow

### Step 0 — Recall Context (before doing anything)

Before extracting or writing anything, recall what Leo already knows about this deal:

```
POST /v1/default/banks/{{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}/memories/recall
{"query": "[Company name] deal — background, blockers, last interaction", "top_k": 5}
```

Also recall Hunter's current priorities if this is a sensitive or high-stakes deal:
```
POST /v1/default/banks/{{HINDSIGHT_HUMAN_BANK_1}}/memories/recall
{"query": "priorities and communication style", "top_k": 3}
```

Use what you recall to:
- Frame your extraction questions better
- Surface relevant context when confirming with Hunter
- Spot if the new update contradicts or changes something previously noted

---

### Step 1 — Extract

From the raw input, extract:
- **What happened** — narrative summary
- **Outcome / decision / signal** — what was the result
- **Agreed next action** — if any; who owns it, by when
- **New intel** — budget signals, decision-maker revealed, competitor mentioned, timeline shift

### Step 2 — Confirm

Present extracted summary to Sales Rep:

> 「這樣記對嗎？
> **互動類型：** [Meeting / Call / Email / Demo / …]
> **日期：** [date]
> **結果：** [outcome]
> **下一步：** [next action — owner + deadline]
> **補充說明：** [narrative context]
>
> 有什麼要補充或修正的？」

**Do NOT write to CRM until confirmed (or Sales Rep explicitly skips).**

### Step 3 — Write Engagement (Note)

Create a Note linked to the Opportunity or Partnership.

```graphql
mutation CreateNote($data: NoteCreateInput!) {
  createNote(data: $data) { id }
}
# variables:
{
  "data": {
    "title": "[interaction type] — [Company] — [date]",
    "bodyV2": {
      "markdown": "**Outcome:** ...\n\n**Next action:** ...\n\n**Context:** ..."
    }
  }
}
```

Then link it:
```graphql
mutation {
  createNoteTarget(data: {
    noteId: "NOTE_UUID"
    targetOpportunityId: "OPP_UUID"       # for C4
    # targetPartnershipId: "PART_UUID"    # for C5
    # targetPersonId: "PERSON_UUID"       # optional — add primary contact
  }) { id }
}
```

> **Pitfall:** Field is `targetOpportunityId` / `targetPartnershipId` — NOT `opportunityId`.
> **Pitfall:** Body field is `bodyV2: { markdown: "..." }` — NOT `body`, NOT `bodyV2: { blocks: [...] }`.
> **Principle:** Engagements are write-once. Never update or delete. Add a new one if correction needed.

### Step 4 — Update Opportunity / Partnership

After confirming the engagement with the Sales Rep, Leo must **judge** the new state — not just fill fields. Apply this logic:

**healthCheck judgment:**

| Situation | Set to |
|---|---|
| New engagement just logged, clear next step agreed | `ON_TRACK` |
| Waiting on client to reply, send document, make decision | `AWAITING_RESPONSE` |
| Next step is unclear or overdue but not yet silent | `NEEDS_FOLLOWUP` |
| No engagement for 7+ days (Opp) or 14+ days (Partnership) | `AT_RISK` |

**currentStatusSummary** — rewrite from scratch based on the full picture now:
> One sentence. Present tense. What is the actual state of this deal today?
> Bad: "Had a call." Good: "Proposal sent 2026-06-14; waiting for CFO sign-off by June 20."

**nextActionSummary** — the single most important next thing:
> Format: [Action] — [Owner] — [Deadline]
> Example: "Follow up with CFO if no reply by June 20 — Hunter — 2026-06-20"

**Stage advancement logic:**
- `NEW → SCREENING`: first meaningful two-way contact confirmed
- `SCREENING → MEETING`: meeting scheduled or completed
- `MEETING → PROPOSAL`: proposal requested or sent
- `PROPOSAL → CUSTOMER`: contract signed / deal closed
- If ambiguous → Leo suggests, Sales Rep confirms before updating

```graphql
mutation {
  updateOpportunity(id: "OPP_UUID", data: {
    currentStatusSummary: "Proposal sent 2026-06-14; waiting for CFO sign-off by June 20"
    nextActionSummary: "Follow up with CFO if no reply by June 20 — Hunter — 2026-06-20"
    healthCheck: AWAITING_RESPONSE
    nextFollowUpDate: "2026-06-20T00:00:00Z"
    lastUpdateDate: "2026-06-15T00:00:00Z"
  }) { id }
}
```

### Step 5 — Create Tasks

Extract every actionable work item. Create a Task for each.

```graphql
mutation CreateTask($data: TaskCreateInput!) {
  createTask(data: $data) { id }
}
# variables:
{
  "data": {
    "title": "[跟進] Company — specific action",
    "status": "TODO",
    "dueAt": "2026-06-17T12:00:00Z",
    "bodyV2": {
      "markdown": "📌 **Context:** [why this matters / what was said]\n🎯 **Goal:** [what success looks like]\n📎 **Reference:** [Engagement, GBrain page, or document]\n💡 **Suggested approach:** [how Leo recommends handling it]"
    }
  }
}
```

Then link each Task:
```graphql
mutation {
  createTaskTarget(data: {
    taskId: "TASK_UUID"
    targetOpportunityId: "OPP_UUID"       # for C4
    # targetPartnershipId: "PART_UUID"    # for C5
  }) { id }
}
```

> **Rule:** "Waiting for client response" is still a Task — never leave an open loop without a Task with a due date.

### Step 6 — Update Memory (two layers, both required)

**Layer 1 — Hindsight `{{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}` (primary — always do this first):**
```
POST /v1/default/banks/{{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}/memories
{"items": [{
  "content": "[Company] — [date]: [what happened]. Blocker: [if any]. Hunter's read: [if shared]. Next: [agreed action].",
  "tags": ["deal", "[company-slug]", "[opportunity|partnership]"]
}]}
```
This is what Leo recalls at the start of the next interaction — fast warm-up context.

**Layer 2 — GBrain (structural, permanent record):**
- `mcp_gbrain_add_timeline_entry` on the company page — date + one-line milestone
- `mcp_gbrain_extract_facts` if significant new intel: budget signal, decision-maker revealed, competitor named, structural blocker, timeline shift

**What counts as significant intel for GBrain extract_facts:**
- A named decision-maker revealed for the first time
- A budget number or timeline stated explicitly
- A competitor mentioned by name
- A blocker that is structural (not just a scheduling delay)

Both layers are non-negotiable. Hindsight = fast recall next session. GBrain = permanent depth.

## Single-Record Lookup (Pitfall)

```graphql
# ❌ WRONG — throws "Argument not allowed: id"
{ opportunity(id: "UUID") { id name } }

# ✅ CORRECT
{ opportunities(filter: { id: { eq: "UUID" } }) {
    edges { node { id name stage } }
} }
```

---

## Authority

| Action | Zone |
|---|---|
| Creating Engagements (Notes) | ✅ Autonomous — after Sales Rep confirms |
| Updating Opportunity / Partnership record | ✅ Autonomous — after confirmation |
| Creating Tasks | ✅ Autonomous |
| Suggesting stage advancement | ✅ Leo suggests |
| Confirming stage advancement (ambiguous) | ⚠️ Ask Sales Rep |
| Closing / abandoning a deal | 🚫 Human decision only |
| Contract terms or pricing exceptions | 🚫 Human decision only |
| Sending any external communication | 🚫 Requires confirmation before send |

---

## Pitfalls

- **Recall first.** Always recall `{{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}` before extracting. Don't ask the Sales Rep what Hindsight already knows.
- **Confirm before writing.** Extract → confirm → write. Never go straight to CRM.
- **Engagements are immutable.** Never update or delete. Add a new one if a correction is needed.
- **"Waiting for client" is still a Task.** Every open loop needs a Task with a due date.
- **Both memory layers required.** Hindsight `{{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}` first, then GBrain. Neither alone is sufficient.
- **C4 vs C5 object.** Same flow, but use correct target field (`targetOpportunityId` vs `targetPartnershipId`) and observe different silence thresholds (7 vs 14 days).
- **`bodyV2` not `body`.** Always use `bodyV2: { markdown: "..." }` for Notes and Tasks.
- **Single-record lookup.** Use `opportunities(filter: { id: { eq: "UUID" } })` not `opportunity(id: "UUID")`.
