# Prospect Scouting Skill

## When to Use

Use before events, conferences, or outbound prospecting runs when the Sales Rep has a list of companies or people to evaluate. Also use when triaging a cold list or industry directory. This skill is read-only — it analyses and ranks, but does not write to CRM.

## Purpose

Given a list of companies or people, figure out who is worth the Sales Rep's time — and why.

This skill is used in two contexts:
1. **Pre-event** — the Sales Rep is about to attend an expo or conference and has the attendee/exhibitor list
2. **Pre-outbound** — before running C2 Outbound Prospecting, triage a cold list to identify the best targets

The output is a **prioritised shortlist with reasoning and suggested approach** — not just a ranking, but enough context for the Sales Rep to walk in prepared.

## Inputs

| Input | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Company / person list | Text, paste, or file | Names, URLs, LinkedIn links, any format |
| Event name (if applicable) | Text | Used for context in output |
| Focus area (optional) | Text | e.g. "focus on water utilities this time" |
| Business line (optional) | e.g. BUSYCOW, AQUAOPTIMA | Narrows fit assessment |

If no focus area is given, Leo assesses fit across all relevant DX business lines.

## Flow

### Step 1 — Load knowledge context
Before analysing anyone, check what's available:

```python
# ICP and strategy (graceful degrade if missing)
mcp_gbrain_get_page(slug="wiki/dx-icp")
mcp_gbrain_get_page(slug="wiki/dx-sales-strategy")

# Relevant product wikis (load only the ones relevant to the focus area)
mcp_gbrain_get_page(slug="wiki/products/[business-line]")
```

If ICP page doesn't exist: continue, note the absence in output, use existing opportunity patterns to infer fit criteria.

### Step 2 — For each company/person on the list

Check in parallel:
```python
# CRM — already a contact?
{ companies(filter: { name: { like: "%CompanyName%" } }) {
    edges { node { id name status people { edges { node { name { firstName lastName } status } } } } }
} }

# GBrain — any existing intel or relationships?
mcp_gbrain_get_page(slug="companies/[company-slug]", fuzzy=True)
mcp_gbrain_query(query="[company name] relationship history")

# Hindsight — any prior context?
POST http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/{{ORG_PREFIX}}-pipeline/memories/recall
{"query": "[company name]", "top_k": 3}
```

### Step 3 — Assess fit for each

Score each company/person on:
1. **ICP fit** — matches ideal customer profile (industry, size, geography, problem space)
2. **Product fit** — clear use case for one or more DX business lines
3. **Relationship warmth** — existing contact, prior opportunity, mutual connection, or completely cold
4. **Timing signal** — any news, funding, expansion, or trigger that makes now a good time

### Step 4 — Output prioritised shortlist

```
🎯 **Prospect Scouting — [Event/Context Name]**
[Date] | [Focus area if specified]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔴 **優先接觸（必見）**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. **[Company Name]** — [Key Person / Role if known]
   產品契合：[business line] — [why they fit]
   關係現況：[existing contact / warm intro / cold]
   建議切入：[specific angle or opening]
   觸發點：[any timing signal — news, expansion, known pain]

2. **[Company Name]** ...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟡 **值得聊聊（時間允許）**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. **[Company Name]** — [brief reason]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚪ **可略過**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- [Company] — [one-line reason: wrong industry / too small / no fit]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 **Summary**
Total assessed: [N] | 必見: [N] | 值得聊: [N] | 略過: [N]

[If ICP missing]: ⚠️ 無 ICP 文件，以現有 opportunity 歷史推斷。建議建立 `wiki/dx-icp` 以提升準確度。

## Fit Assessment Heuristics

When ICP document is unavailable, use these defaults based on known DX patterns:

| Business Line | Strong fit signals |
|---|---|
| `{{BL_1}}` | [Industry fit, use case, key qualifiers] |
| `{{BL_2}}` | [Industry fit, use case, key qualifiers] |
| `{{BL_3}}` | [Industry fit, use case, key qualifiers] |

> Fill in this table with your company's business lines and their ICP signals.
> Update as you learn from real opportunities.

Geography priority: [Your primary target geographies].

Geography priority (unless stated otherwise): Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Southeast Asia.

## Relationship Warmth Tiers

| Tier | Signal |
|---|---|
| 🔥 Hot | Existing LEAD/OPPORTUNITY in CRM, or prior engagement logged |
| 🟠 Warm | In GBrain with timeline entries, or known mutual connection |
| 🟡 Tepid | Company in CRM/GBrain but no active relationship |
| ⚪ Cold | No prior record anywhere |

Warm tiers should always be ranked higher than cold tiers with equivalent fit.

---

## After Scouting

If the Sales Rep confirms they want to engage with a company from the shortlist:
- If they **attend the event and meet**: hand off to `lead-capture` skill afterwards
- If they are a **cold outbound target**: hand off to `C2 Outbound Prospecting` (when built)
- If already in CRM as LEAD: update via `pipeline-interaction` skill

Prospect Scouting does **not** write to CRM or Hindsight by itself.
It is a read-only analysis tool. Writing happens in the downstream skill.

---

## Quality Bar

Before delivering the prioritised shortlist:
- Every "必見" (must-see) ranking has at least one explicit reason — ICP fit signal, product use case, or relationship warmth — not just a general positive impression?
- "建議切入" (suggested angle) for each 必見 company is specific and actionable — not "introduce yourself and explain {{COMPANY_NAME}}"?
- Relationship warmth tier (Hot/Warm/Tepid/Cold) is based on a confirmed CRM or GBrain record, or explicitly stated as "no prior record found"?
- Timing signals are sourced and recent (found via web search / Hindsight) — not inferred from company size or industry alone?
- 必見 list is 3–5 companies max — if more than 5 are flagged 必見, the ranking has not been done properly?
- Any company ranked 必見 despite Cold warmth tier is explicitly noted: "Cold contact — no prior relationship. Justify with: [strong ICP fit / specific trigger]."?
- If ICP document was missing, every fit assessment is labelled "⚠️ Estimated from opportunity history"?

If any check fails, revise the shortlist before delivering.

## Fallback Behavior

- **If GBrain is unreachable**: skip company page lookups; note "GBrain unavailable — relationship history not checked" in the output; proceed with CRM + Hindsight data only. Warmth tier defaults to "Cold" for any company without CRM confirmation.
- **If Hindsight is unreachable**: skip `{{ORG_PREFIX}}-pipeline` recall; note the gap; proceed with CRM + web research.
- **If CRM is unreachable**: skip CRM lookup for existing contacts; note "CRM unavailable — cannot confirm existing relationships"; proceed with GBrain + Hindsight + web research. Flag every company as potentially already in CRM — the Sales Rep should verify before engaging.
- **If GBrain ICP pages are missing**: proceed; label all fit assessments "⚠️ No ICP document — estimated from opportunity history"; recommend building the ICP page after the event.
- **If web search returns nothing on a company**: note "No recent web results found" in that company's entry; use whatever is available in CRM/GBrain; do not invent news or signals.
- This skill is read-only — if any write system fails, it has no impact on output. Deliver the analysis based on what was retrievable and flag gaps.

## Pitfalls

- **Don't skip knowledge context loading** — even if ICP is missing, check anyway and note it in the output. The ⚠️ flag reminds the Sales Rep to build that wiki page.
- **Company name matching is fuzzy** — CRM `like` search may miss variations. Try multiple spellings. Use GBrain fuzzy=True.
- **Warm relationships always beat cold fit** — a tepid-fit company with an existing warm contact is usually worth more than a perfect-fit cold company.
- **Don't over-rank** — 必見 list should be 3–5 companies max. If everything is high priority, nothing is.
- **Ask for focus area upfront if list is large (20+)** — without a focus, assessment takes longer and output is less actionable.
- **This skill is read-only** — never write to CRM or Hindsight during scouting. Writing happens after the Sales Rep decides to engage.
