# {{INTERNAL_WIKI_REPO}} Content Architecture

## What it is

`{{INTERNAL_WIKI_REPO}}` is the human-readable Layer 1 of the {{COMPANY_NAME}} knowledge stack. Iris writes here after key decisions/conversations. Agents read via GBrain (Iris extracts and syncs).

## Document Template Pattern

New installs: copy templates from `{{AGENT_PACKAGE_REPO}}/wiki-setup/` into `context/`.

Each template includes:
- A header note explaining what it is and who uses it
- Structured code blocks with `[bracket]` placeholders
- `⚠️` callouts for special actions (e.g. create /products/ subfolder)

| Template | Primary agent reader | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `company-background.md` | All agents | First |
| `team.md` | All agents | First |
| `product-overview.md` | Leo, Maya | First |
| `sales-strategy.md` | Leo | First (Pipeline Health Check input) |
| `brand-messaging.md` | Maya, Leo | Before content creation |
| `key-contacts.md` | Leo, Iris | Before outreach |

## ROLE.md Format (for agents/ directory)

Each agent ROLE.md follows this structure:
1. **Role** — one paragraph, what they own, what they are NOT
2. **Position in the Org** — table of functions and owners
3. **Core Responsibilities** — grouped by theme, bullet points
4. **What [Agent] Owns** — metric table (the numbers they track)
5. **Boundaries** — what they handle, what human handles, what they do NOT do
6. **Funnel Position** — ASCII flow diagram
7. **Tools** — table of tools, purposes

## Knowledge Flow

```
Conversation (human + Iris)
    ↓ Iris writes after key decisions
{{INTERNAL_WIKI_REPO}} (GitHub, human-readable)
    ↓ Iris extracts with mcp_gbrain_put_page / extract_facts
GBrain (agent-queryable, daily operations)
    ↓ agents act on GBrain context
Hindsight (episodic memory — what happened)
```

Agents query GBrain for daily ops. They do NOT read the wiki directly.
If GBrain has no answer → agent asks Iris → Iris reads wiki and updates GBrain.

## Terminology Rules

- Sales pipeline objects: **Opportunity** (not Deal) — matches Twenty CRM object names
- Exception: CRM field names (`dealType`, `dealId`) and skill dir names (`deal-progressing/`) are technical identifiers — do not rename
- Company objects: Company, People, Opportunity (matching Twenty CRM exactly)
