# Task Advice

> Knowing what to do is not enough. Knowing *how* to do it well — with full context,
> the right angle, and the right words — is what separates a deal that moves from
> one that stalls.

---

## Purpose

When a Sales Rep has a task but is unsure how to approach it, Leo provides
specific, reasoned advice by pulling together everything it knows about the deal:

- What has been said and done before
- Where things got stuck
- What the other party cares about
- What the best next move looks like — and how to execute it

This is not generic sales advice. It is advice rooted in the deepest available
context for this specific deal, this specific person, at this specific moment.

---

## When to Use This

- Sales Rep asks "what should I do for [task]?"
- Sales Rep is preparing for a call or meeting and wants angles
- A task is overdue and the rep doesn't know how to restart
- An AT_RISK deal needs a recovery approach
- Rep is stuck and needs a thinking partner

---

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1 — Identify the Task and Deal

Extract from the request:
- **Task title** — what exactly needs to be done
- **Company / deal** — which Opportunity or Partnership
- **Deadline** — how urgent is this

If unclear, ask: 「是哪個 deal 的哪個 task？」

### Step 2 — Pull All Available Context

Run all three memory layers in parallel:

**CRM — current deal state:**
```graphql
{
  opportunities(filter: { name: { like: "%CompanyName%" } }) {
    edges { node {
      id name stage healthCheck
      currentStatusSummary nextActionSummary
      nextFollowUpDate
      notes { edges { node { title bodyV2 { markdown } createdAt } } }
      tasks(filter: { status: { eq: TODO } }) {
        edges { node { title dueAt bodyV2 { markdown } } }
      }
    }}
  }
}
```

**Hindsight — deal contextual memory:**
```
POST /v1/default/banks/{{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}}/memories/recall
{"query": "[Company] deal — history, blockers, decision-maker, what worked", "top_k": 7}
```

**Hindsight — company-level facts:**
```
POST /v1/default/banks/{{HINDSIGHT_GLOBAL_BANK}}/memories/recall
{"query": "[Company] — key facts, product fit, stakeholders", "top_k": 3}
```

**GBrain — relationship context (if relevant):**
```
mcp_gbrain_query(query="[Company] [key contact name] relationship history")
```

### Step 3 — Reason Through the Advice

With all context in hand, reason through:

1. **What is the real goal of this task?**
   Not just the literal action — what outcome does completing it move toward?

2. **What does the other party care about right now?**
   Based on past interactions, what are their priorities, concerns, objections?

3. **What has worked / not worked before with this deal?**
   Are there patterns? Sensitivities? Things that got a reaction?

4. **What is the specific recommended approach?**
   - What to say or write (exact framing if possible)
   - What angle to take
   - What to avoid
   - What a good outcome looks like for this interaction

5. **What should the rep watch for or listen for?**
   Signals that would change the situation — positive or negative.

### Step 4 — Deliver Advice

Format:

```
📋 Task Advice — [Task title]
🏢 Deal: [Company] — [Stage] — [healthCheck]

**The real goal:**
[What this task is actually trying to achieve in the bigger picture]

**Context that matters:**
[2-3 most relevant facts from memory — what was said, what the blocker is, what the other party cares about]

**Recommended approach:**
[Specific, actionable — what to say, what angle to take, how to open]

**Watch for:**
[Signals to listen for in the interaction]

**If it goes well → next step:**
[What to do immediately after a positive response]

**If it's awkward / no response → fallback:**
[Recovery move]
```

## Depth Principle

Generic advice = "follow up and check in."
Good advice = "They stalled because the CFO wasn't looped in. Lead with the ROI number from the Yilan case study — that's what moved Taiwan Water. Ask if it would help to get a 15-min intro call with our technical lead."

**The advice is only as good as the context Leo has.** If {{HINDSIGHT_PIPELINE_BANK}} is empty for this deal, the advice will be shallow. This is why logging engagements is non-negotiable.

## Authority

| Action | Zone |
|---|---|
| Providing task advice | ✅ Autonomous |
| Suggesting specific wording or angles | ✅ Autonomous |
| Deciding what the rep should do | ⚠️ Advisory only — human decides |
| Sending any external communication | 🚫 Requires confirmation before send |

---

## Pitfalls

- **Don't give generic advice.** If context is thin, say so and ask Leo to log past interactions first.
- **Don't overwhelm.** One clear recommended approach is better than five options.
- **Advice must reference actual context.** If you can't point to something specific from memory, you're guessing.
- **Always end with a next step.** Advice without a clear action is incomplete.
