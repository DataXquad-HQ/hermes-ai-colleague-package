# Create Report-Back Task

> When a Sales Rep mentions a future meeting, call, or demo — Leo immediately
> creates a Report-Back Task. This is the mechanism by which Leo detects
> "the meeting was planned but never reported."

---

## Purpose

When Hunter mentions a planned future interaction, Leo:
1. Creates a **Report-Back Task** due on the meeting date EOD
2. Links it to the relevant Opportunity or Partnership in Twenty CRM
3. After the due date, if no new Engagement (Note) exists → Task appears overdue → surfaces in daily briefing

This closes the loop: if the Task goes overdue, either the meeting didn't happen, or it wasn't logged. Either way, Leo flags it.

---

## Trigger Signals

Create a Report-Back Task whenever the Sales Rep mentions:
- A scheduled meeting / call / demo
- A planned follow-up conversation
- "I'm meeting them on [date]"
- "We have a call next [weekday]"
- Any future interaction with a named company or person

Leo should do this **proactively** — even if the Sales Rep doesn't explicitly ask.

---

## Task Format

```
Title:  [Log Interaction] [Company] — [interaction type] on [date]
Status: TODO
Due:    [meeting date] EOD (23:59 local time, or use 15:00 UTC as proxy)
Owner:  [Sales Rep]
Priority: Medium
```

**Body (agent advice):**
```
📌 Context: [Company] [interaction type] scheduled for [date].
   This task is a reminder to report back to Leo after the meeting so the
   interaction gets logged in CRM.

🎯 Goal: Report back to Leo with what happened — outcome, decisions, next steps.
   Leo will then create the Engagement record and any follow-up Tasks.

💡 Suggested: After the meeting, just message Leo with a quick update.
   Even a one-liner is enough to start — Leo will ask clarifying questions.
```

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1 — Identify

Extract from what the Sales Rep said:
- **Company name** (look up in CRM if needed)
- **Interaction type** — Meeting / Call / Demo / Contract Review / etc.
- **Date** — confirm if ambiguous (e.g. "next Tuesday" → resolve to exact date)
- **Linked record** — which Opportunity or Partnership does this relate to?

### Step 2 — Look Up Parent Record

Find the active Opportunity or Partnership for this company:

```graphql
{
  opportunities(filter: {
    name: { like: "%CompanyName%" }
    stage: { notIn: [CUSTOMER] }
  }) {
    edges { node { id name stage currentStatusSummary } }
  }
}
```

Or for Partnership:
```graphql
{
  partnerships(filter: {
    name: { like: "%CompanyName%" }
  }) {
    edges { node { id name stage } }
  }
}
```

> If multiple records found, ask Sales Rep to confirm which one.

### Step 3 — Create the Task

```graphql
mutation CreateTask($data: TaskCreateInput!) {
  createTask(data: $data) { id }
}
# variables:
{
  "data": {
    "title": "[Log Interaction] CompanyName — Call on 2026-06-17",
    "status": "TODO",
    "dueAt": "2026-06-17T15:00:00Z",
    "bodyV2": {
      "markdown": "📌 **Context:** CompanyName call scheduled for 2026-06-17.\nThis task is a reminder to report back to Leo after the call so the interaction gets logged in CRM.\n\n🎯 **Goal:** Report back to Leo with outcome, decisions, and next steps.\n\n💡 **Suggested:** After the call, message Leo with a quick update — even a one-liner is fine."
    }
  }
}
```

> **Pitfall:** Body field is `bodyV2: { markdown: "..." }` — NOT `body`, NOT `bodyV2: { blocks: [...] }`.

### Step 4 — Link Task to Parent Record

```graphql
mutation {
  createTaskTarget(data: {
    taskId: "TASK_UUID"
    targetOpportunityId: "OPP_UUID"       # for C4
    # targetPartnershipId: "PART_UUID"    # for C5
  }) { id }
}
```

> **Pitfall:** Field is `targetOpportunityId` / `targetPartnershipId` — NOT `opportunityId`.

### Step 5 — Confirm to Sales Rep

After creating:

> 「已幫你建好報回 Task：
> 📅 **[Log Interaction] CompanyName — Call on June 17**
> 到時候通完話跟我說一下結果，我來幫你記進去。」

---

## What Happens Next (Detection Loop)

After the due date, Leo's daily briefing checks for overdue Report-Back Tasks:

```
For each overdue Task with title starting with "[Log Interaction]":
  Check if a new Engagement (Note) exists for the linked record since the task was created
  If NO new Engagement found:
    → Flag in daily briefing: "Meeting with [Company] on [date] — interaction not yet logged"
    → Prompt Sales Rep to report back
```

This is how Leo maintains the detection loop without asking the Sales Rep to remember to report.

---

## Single-Record Lookup (Pitfall)

```graphql
# ❌ WRONG — throws "Argument not allowed: id"
{ opportunity(id: "UUID") { id name } }

# ✅ CORRECT
{ opportunities(filter: { id: { eq: "UUID" } }) {
    edges { node { id name stage } }
} }
```

## Authority

| Action | Zone |
|---|---|
| Creating Report-Back Tasks | ✅ Autonomous — do it proactively |
| Linking Task to Opportunity / Partnership | ✅ Autonomous |
| Resolving ambiguous date ("next Tuesday") | ✅ Autonomous — confirm if uncertain |
| Selecting correct Opportunity if multiple | ⚠️ Ask Sales Rep to confirm |

---

## Pitfalls

- **Create proactively.** Don't wait to be asked. If a future meeting is mentioned, create the Task immediately.
- **`bodyV2` not `body`.** Always use `bodyV2: { markdown: "..." }`.
- **`targetOpportunityId` not `opportunityId`.** Use the correct TaskTarget field.
- **Date ambiguity.** "Next Tuesday" needs to be resolved to an exact date. Confirm if you're not certain of the date.
- **Multiple matching records.** If more than one active Opportunity or Partnership matches the company, ask which one.
