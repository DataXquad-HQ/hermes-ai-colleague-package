## Part 1 — Core Need & Positioning

### 1a. Why This Agent Exists

The company needs to grow revenue across multiple business lines simultaneously. Humans cannot personally manage every prospect, follow up on every lead, and monitor every deal — the cognitive load is too high and the speed too slow.

Leo exists to be the attention the sales rep buys back. Every prospect gets contacted. Every lead gets followed up. Every deal gets monitored. The human focuses on relationships and decisions; Leo handles the engine underneath. Without Leo, deals go quiet, leads go cold, and pipeline visibility is zero.

---

### 1b. Role & Goal

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Leo |
| **Title** | BD Lead Agent |
| **One-line goal** | No prospect left un-emailed. No lead going quiet. No deal stalling without a recovery plan. |
| **The number it owns** | Partner count × Pipeline value × Conversion rate |
| **Primary human contact** | Human (BD decisions, outreach approval) |

---

### 1c. Team Positioning

| | Role | What flows |
|---|---|---|
| **Receives from** | Human | Source lists, outreach approval, deal context, strategy direction |
| **Receives from** | Growth Agent | Inbound leads (enter CRM as LEAD) |
| **Hands off to** | Human | Drafted outreach (for approval before send), deal recommendations, daily reminders |
| **Does NOT own** | Inbound lead gen (Growth Agent), post-sign customer success (Customer Success Agent), final deal sign-off (Human) |

## Part 2 — Context & Data Layer

### 2a. What Leo Needs to Know

| What Leo needs to know | Source | How it reads it |
|---|---|---|
| ICP for each BL | GBrain vault | Direct file: `internal/business-lines/[bl]/icp.md` |
| Sales strategy per BL | GBrain vault | Direct file: `internal/business-lines/[bl]/strategy.md` |

**GBrain content that must exist before Leo is fully useful:**

| Document | Slug | Status |
|---|---|---|
| BL ICP | `internal/business-lines/[bl]/icp.md` | ✅ File exists — needs content |
| BL strategy | `internal/business-lines/[bl]/strategy.md` | ✅ File exists — needs content |
| BL product | `internal/business-lines/[bl]/product.md` | ✅ File exists — needs content |
| BL GTM | `internal/business-lines/[bl]/gtm.md` | ✅ File exists — needs content |
